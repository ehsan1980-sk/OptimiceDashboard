# Project Proposal

![homepage](public/assets/homepage.png)

## Intro

This project __OptimiceDashboard__ is again a complimentary project of my physical project [OptiMice](https://jasontsemf.github.io/optimice.html) that was first exhibited at 2019 ITP Winter Show. The ultimate deliverable of this project is to develop a business, which includes a __web platform__ that allows users to

1. Upload images for photogrammetry analysis

2. View the post-analysis 3D model

3. Configure and make orders

4. Post-order hardware configurating software

That said, I have to finish them eventually no matter what. I have to try my best to finish/prototype at least one of the above four, ideally 2 (maybe).

## Expectation

Here are some of the technical elements that I want to include

- User Profile: frontend and table on `MongoDB`

- Order: frontend and table on `MongoDB`

- Using three.js to show a 3D interpretation of a mouse model
