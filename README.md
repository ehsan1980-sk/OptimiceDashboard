# Project Proposal

## Intro

This project __OptimiceDashboard__ is again a complimentary project of my physical project [OptiMice](https://jasontsemf.github.io/optimice.html) that was first exhibited at 2019 ITP Winter Show. The ultimate deliverable of this project is to develop a business, which includes a __web platform__ that allows users to

1. Upload images for photogrammetry analysis

2. View the post-analysis 3D model

3. Configure the order in 3D
